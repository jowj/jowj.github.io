  <h2 id="starcraft-ii">Starcraft II</h2>
<p>I used to compete in Starcraft II. I never did actually make it to pro level, but I did actually make money from playing sometimes. I eventually got to Rank1 Master (just outside the top200 in the US). Here&rsquo;s me beating a middling famous streamer (who rages):</p>

</ul>
<p>While I never made pro I did stick around in the scene, eventually writing for TeamLiquid Strategy. I wrote a bunch, a few front pagers and a lot more posts/guides/breakdowns. Here&rsquo;s what I could find, including my biggest piece:</p>

<ul>
<li>This is the piece I was most known for. I wrote the zerg section of this. Jaedong fans usually liked, JD tweeted about it I think? It made rounds on reddits, I was really proud of it.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>I wrote more than that but a lot of the writing ended up in the public strategy forum which is essentially a blackhole for finding it. Yeesh.</p>
