<p>we flew in to seattle from austin at 845 am. don’t take that flight it was fucking horrible but it did give us a full day there despite flying for 4 hours.</p>
<h3 id="sheri-s-house">sheri’s house</h3>
<p>we drove around a bunch, but we started the night at sheri’s. we saw new (baby!) cats and ate good food and had our photo taken by a family friend.

<p>i forgot to take pictures this trip so here’s some from last year:</p>
<p>this is jill’s back porch and it feels fake to me. so many trees it’s stunning.

<p>we played a lot of mule, an old atari 800 game. it’s a lot of fun; laura hates computer games but since this is just a board game with calculations and tabulations done by a computer she sorta fell in love</p>
