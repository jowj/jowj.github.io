      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-should-have-an-ask-security-channel&#34;&gt;You should have an #ask-security channel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently had a conversation at work on this topic and I wanted to jot down some of my thoughts about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should have an #ask-security channel, and either every service owner within your security org should monitor it, or you should have your SOC triage it and tag in sevice owners as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having an explicit venue for security conversations provides a bunch of benefits, like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moving from 1pass to bitwarden</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;background&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a 1pass user for a long time. I started with 1pass4; I used it with Mac and Windows endpoints. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it on iOS for almost that entire time. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to use other things, like Enpass when I first tried to move to linux as a home os, or LastPass for certain jobs, but frankly none of them hold up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since early 2019 i&amp;rsquo;ve been running linux at home for everything and that has finally made 1password too painful such that i&amp;rsquo;m moving off of it. 1pass is a great app and has fantastic compatability for most people but it sucks horribly on linux; until now i&amp;rsquo;ve been using 1passX with a 1password.com account. This is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; way to use 1password on a linux os. 1pass4 ran fine under wine, 1pass6 i think could work for some people (but i never got it to).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;no-new-problems&#34;&gt;no new problems&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;i recently started a new job and am faced with the usual: &amp;ldquo;please set up our scanners and Make Us Secure&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What Do These Alerts Mean&amp;rdquo;, etc etc. i keep thinking about the scanning / threat and vulnerability management (TVM) aspect, so i want to write about that. here are a list of questions that i&amp;rsquo;ve been asking myself, along with some possible answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-an-existing-scanning-install-or-starting-over&#34;&gt;using an existing scanning install or starting over&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;it may be reasonable to nuke an install if:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
