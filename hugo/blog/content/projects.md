I've worked on a few things that i'm proud of. Here's the highlights.

## [Pynit](https://git.awful.club/projects/pynit)
- Created: 2019
- Status: Archived
pynit is a personal archival script that relies on pinboard. it pulls in saved posts through the reddit api (by way of ~praw~) and adds them to the linked ~pinboard~ account. I've written briefly about what I learned during this project [here](../posts/pynit/).

## [jowj.net](https://me.jowj.net/)
- Created: 2016
- Status: Maintained
This site! This site is a +cursed collection of elisp+ cool experiment in running a blog using orgmode and elisp. I've written about this project [../posts/blogging-on-ghpages-with-orgmode.html](here).
