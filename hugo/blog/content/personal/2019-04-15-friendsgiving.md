## look at how pretty this fucking table is {#look-at-how-pretty-this-fucking-table-is}

my sister made a bunch of that stuff there; the candles were all melted on to the wood and the gourds that they were resting on; the wreathes of Whatever Plant were picked from her garden; even the table it all sat on was made by my sister and her family

it’s lovely and makes me feel fucking warm to have been there.
