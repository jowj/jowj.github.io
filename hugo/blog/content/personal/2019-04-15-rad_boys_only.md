## rad boys only {#rad-boys-only}

we are boys and we are rad
sometimes our cooking makes us sad

but not this time, this time we made ceviche and it was fucking bomb


### we were gonna play games first tho {#we-were-gonna-play-games-first-tho}

noah’s desk, was so large
it was, like, the size of a barge

micah’s desk was very sad
it was so small
and so lonely
