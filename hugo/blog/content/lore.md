## Starcraft II
I used to compete in Starcraft II. I never did actually make it to pro level, but I did actually make money from playing sometimes. I eventually got to Rank1 Master (just outside the top200 in the US). Here's me beating a middling famous streamer (who rages):

While I never made pro I did stick around in the scene, eventually writing for TeamLiquid Strategy. I wrote a bunch, a few front pagers and a lot more posts/guides/breakdowns. Here's what I could find, including my biggest piece:

  - https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/485152-spl15-style-start-sbenu
  - https://tl.net/forum/sc2-strategy/448648-zvp-at-its-finest-jaedong-vs-patience
- This is the piece I was most known for. I wrote the zerg section of this. Jaedong fans usually liked, JD tweeted about it I think? It made rounds on reddits, I was really proud of it.

I wrote more than that but a lot of the writing ended up in the public strategy forum which is essentially a blackhole for finding it. Yeesh.
