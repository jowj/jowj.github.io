I've worked on a few things that i'm proud of. Here's the highlights.

## [Halfhazard]()
- Created: 2024
- Status: Maintained

I wrote [Halfhazard](https://github.com/jowj/halfhazard), a small app for keeping track of budgeting and billing for me and my partner. Its rough around the edges, has a handful of UI bugs, and will never be officially published on the app store (I pay for an Apple developer account and just use testflight builds for us), but I am now doing billing on it full time instead of through [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/), our previous tracker.

## [Pynit](https://git.awful.club/projects/pynit)
- Created: 2019
- Status: Archived

pynit is a personal archival script that relies on pinboard. it pulls in saved posts through the reddit api (by way of ~praw~) and adds them to the linked ~pinboard~ account. I've written briefly about what I learned during this project [here](../posts/pynit/).

## [jowj.net](https://archive.jowj.net/)
- Created: 2016
- Status: Archived

A previous iteration of my blog. This site is a ~cursed collection of elisp~ cool experiment in running a blog using orgmode and elisp. I've written about this project [here](../posts/blogging-on-ghpages-with-orgmode.html).
