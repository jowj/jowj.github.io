# get zmk studio working with the ergodox advantage 360 pro
ZMK studio is a fabulous GUI tool for modifying your ZMK config. I am frustrated at how long it took me to set up ZMK studio with my adv360 - I was confused by several different pages within the ZMK project + the intermittent issues I had that ended up being caused by USB cables (ðŸ˜ž). I also couldn't find an example of a working config for the adv360 to reference when troubleshooting - to save anyone else time, here is my config that works with your adv360pro.

## ZMK docs
ZMK docs are pretty good, but they do send you all over the place from their announcement post. You want this link:
- https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

This process works! But if you've plugged your kb in via a hub, or with an older cable, you may run into issues and think it's incorrect!

Keyboards, good lord.
