# get zmk studio working with the ergodox advantage 360 pro
I am frustrated at how long it took me to set up ZMK studio with my adv360. `studio` is a fabulous tool, but I was confused by several different pages within the ZMK project + the intermittent issues I had that ended up being caused by USB cables ( :( ). To save anyone else time, here is my config that works with your adv360pro.

- https://github.com/jowj/zmk-config/tree/1976d3edecaafc8d05ccb64455c14c1188857299

## ZMK docs
ZMK docs are pretty good, but they do send you all over the place from their announcement post. You want this link:
- https://zmk.dev/docs/user-setup

This process works! But if you've plugged your kb in via a hub, or with an older cable, you may run into issues and think it's incorrect!

Keyboards, good lord.
